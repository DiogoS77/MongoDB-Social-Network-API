## Description

This project consists in a MongoDB Social Network API that will give us some details when we request from it. We are able to get information about Users, Thoughts, Friends and Reactions. Also using this API we can update them, creaate and delete them. This project contains 15 JavaScript files .

The biggest challenge for me during this project was the refactoring process, since i used mini project 28 as a base i had to adjust a lot , and at the end i noticed a lot of namings were different from what they were supposed to be. Another challenge was definitly the testing in postman since i still dont work that good with it. 

This challenge helped me a lot because it made my understanding of API higher and also made more confident while working with postman in terms of fetiching the information and organise it so its understandable. There was a few more point in where this challenge helped me that i will be listing bellow.

- Better use of Postman
- Better API use
- Higher understanding of JavaScript
